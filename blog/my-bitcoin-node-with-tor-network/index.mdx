A few days ago, I started maintaining a Bitcoin Core Full Node. I keep it running for 24 hours. I am now one of 4500+ nodes of unknown locations.

Put it running through the Tor network; with it, the node's location is unknown.

I'm happy to be able to help people to have more freedom. Today we finally have the condition to have something that really is ours!

Your money in the bank is not yours. Your property is not yours. Not even your degree is yours. Public justice can take all of this away from you for no reason.

Bitcoins no one can take from you no matter how hard they try, and now I can participate in it.

Your bitcoins are yours; do what you want without telling anyone.

Be free and defend everyone's freedom.
