I had a problem with a disk mount in my Ubuntu. When it happens, my docker service starts with an error. The error is why my docker data is on this disk.

To fix this, I changed the docker service configuration to wait for a disk mount before starting. I learned the correct way to do this correctly.

First, you must understand that the fire responsible for initializing the docker service in Ubuntu is <code>/lib/systemd/system/docker.service</code>, and it's managed by Docker, so we must not change this.

To change the behavior of the service, we need to create a directory  <code>/etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/</code> and inside, then create a file <code>mount.conf</code>:

```text
[Unit]
RequiresMountsFor=/mnt/disk1
```

This configuration will add or change the RequiresMountsFor configuration of the file <code>/lib/systemd/system/docker.service</code> using the value <code>/mnt/disk1</code>, which is the disk name I need to wait to be mounted before docker start.

After creating the file in <code>/etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/</code>, you must reload the systemd daemon for the changes to take effect using the command:
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

After that, you can restart the docker service to apply the changes with the command:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

Every time the docker service is initialized, it will verify if a disk has been mounted before.
