This post is my first experience with Orange Pi 5, and I had to do some different things to put it all together working.

The equipment:
 - MicroSD card A2 64g
 - Orange Pi 5 16g RAM

The idea of this post is to start from the moment you have an operating system working in your Orange Pi 5. There are a lot of guides teaching this on the internet, so it's not worth wasting time on it. I used this video to learn, and it is phenomenal.

`youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBqV4QWj0lE`

I selected the <code>Orangepi5_1.1.0_ubuntu_jammy_desktop_xfce_linux5.10.110.7z</code> image, so if you chose another one, some things here might not apply to you.

To see the options of images, use the Orange Pi website, this [link](http://www.orangepi.org/html/serviceAndSupport/index.html).

I got the desktop version because [Umbrel](https://umbrel.com/) needs a graph interface. Another request of Umbrel is a SO with 64 bits.

The Orange Pi 5 CPU supports 64 bits, but I don't know why they don't add this to the image I spoke about before, so we need to run the following command:
```bash
sudo dpkg --add-architecture amd64 ## adding 64-bits architecture package
```

Now we can install Umbrel. Here I had another problem, I only have a 64 GB MicroSD Card. I could run out of space quickly (I want to add more things to the PC), so I decided to put a 2T external hard drive on the USB 3 port of the Orange Pi. To do this right, that's what I could do with my poor knowledge of Linux. I learned a lot from this video:

`youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z6ouBYfZr8`

I had to mount the external hard drive in the <code>mnt</code> folder because I wanted it as part of my system.

To do this, insert the external hard drive into the USB, then use the <code>lsblk</code> command:

```bash
> lsblk

NAME        MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
sda           8:0    0  1.8T  0 disk
└─sda1        8:1    0  1.8T  0 part
mtdblock0    31:0    0   16M  0 disk
mmcblk1     179:0    0 59.5G  0 disk
├─mmcblk1p1 179:1    0  256M  0 part /boot
└─mmcblk1p2 179:2    0 58.6G  0 part /var/log.hdd
                                     /
zram0       254:0    0  7.7G  0 disk [SWAP]
zram1       254:1    0  200M  0 disk /var/log
```

You should see something with the name <code>sda</code> or similar...
That's the name Linux gives when you have something on USB.

With this name in hand, let's do the following:
```bash
cd /mnt
mkdir disk1
sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/disk1/
```

The <code>/dev/</code> is standard, and you should add it in front of <code>sda1</code> or a similar name you have there.

The following parameter is <code>/mnt/disk1/</code>, where it will mount. Once done, the next step is to install and configure docker. I didn't have any problems with the installation, so you shouldn't either. Just follow any of [these options](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).

Once established, I wanted to change where docker will save the data. Docker keeps everything in a single directory. The default value is <code>/var/lib/docker</code>. In my case, I want it to save on my external hard drive. To do this, we will create a folder on it and configure docker:

I am considering two things in the script. One is that the <code>daemon.json</code> file does not exist. It is not created during the installation of docker. The second point is that I use nano to edit the file. Do as you think is best.

```bash
cd /mnt/disk1
mkdir docker-data
cd /etc/docker
touch daemon.json
nano daemon.json
```

The file should stay like this:

```json
{
  "data-root" : "/mnt/disk1/docker-data"
}
```

Now, restart the docker

```bash
service docker restart
```

If you do an <code>ls /mnt/disk1/docker-data</code> you will see several items created. Let's install Umbrel now. I also want to install it on my external hard drive. By default, it will store the applications' data in the <code>app-data</code> folder created where it was installed. To install, I used the command below with three parameters, one to change the directory and two to not install the docker because we already installed it.

```bash
cd /mnt/disk1
mkdir umbrel
curl -L https://umbrel.sh | bash -s -- --install-path /mnt/disk1/umbrel/ --no-install-docker --no-install-compose
```

The final log of command will be something like that:
```bash
Creating manager   ... done
Creating auth      ... done
Creating tor_proxy ... done
Creating dashboard ... done
Creating nginx     ... done

Exiting iptables setup when not on Umbrel OS

Starting installed apps...

Umbrel is now accessible at

Umbrel has been sucessfully installed!

When you open this URL in the browser, Umbrel will already be ready. Just install the apps you want and enjoy.
