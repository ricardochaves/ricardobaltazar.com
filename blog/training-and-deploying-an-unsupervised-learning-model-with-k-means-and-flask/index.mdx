In this article, we will explore the training of an unsupervised machine learning model using the K-means algorithm and then expose this model through a Flask API. The focus of this article is for an audience that already works with technology but is not an expert in machine learning.

## **Unsupervised Learning**

Unsupervised learning is a set of machine learning techniques that analyze and cluster data without a predefined "answer key." Unsupervised algorithms seek patterns and structures in the data without using prior output labels. The goal is to find natural groupings, relationships, or patterns in the data.

## **K-means Algorithm**

The K-means algorithm is a popular unsupervised learning technique that relies on grouping data into K distinct clusters, where K is a predetermined number of clusters. The algorithm aims to minimize the sum of the distances between data points and cluster centroids by iteratively adjusting the centroid positions until the clusters stabilize.

## **Iris Dataset**

The Iris dataset is a popular dataset consisting of 150 samples of iris flowers from three different species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. Each sample contains four features (sepal length and width, petal length and width). Our goal is to use the K-means algorithm to cluster the samples into three clusters, corresponding to the three iris species.

## **Training the K-means Model**

Let's start by training our K-means model on the Iris dataset. We will use the scikit-learn library in Python to train the model. First, we load the Iris dataset, create a DataFrame, and train the K-means model with K=3.

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

# Load the Iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
data = iris.data
target = iris.target

# Create a DataFrame with the data and columns
iris_df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=iris.feature_names)

# Train the K-means model with K=3
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42)
kmeans.fit(iris_df)
```

## **Exporting the Trained Model**

To save and load the trained model, we will use the <code>joblib</code> library. First, we save the trained model to a file.

```python
import joblib

# Save the trained model to a file
joblib.dump(kmeans, 'kmeans_model.joblib')
```

## **Creating a Flask API**

Now that we have trained and saved our model, we can create a Flask API to expose the model and make predictions.

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import numpy as np
import joblib

app = Flask(__name__)

# Load the trained model
kmeans = joblib.load('kmeans_model.joblib')

@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    input_data = request.json
    features = [input_data['sepal_length'], input_data['sepal_width'], input_data['petal_length'], input_data['petal_width']]
    features = np.array(features).reshape(1, -1)
    cluster = kmeans.predict(features)
    return jsonify({'cluster': int(cluster[0])})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Next, start the Flask server by running the <code>app.py</code> file.

```bash
python app.py
```

Now, the API is available at <code>http://localhost:5000/predict</code>. We can make POST requests to this URL with a JSON containing the Iris feature values (sepal length and width, petal length and width) and get the predicted cluster as a response.

## **Example POST request using curl on Linux**

Here is an example of how to make a POST request to the API using the <code>curl</code> command on Linux:

```
bashCopy code
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"sepal_length": 5.1, "sepal_width": 3.5, "petal_length": 1.4, "petal_width": 0.2}' http://localhost:5000/predict

```

This command sends a POST request to the API with the <code>Content-Type: application/json</code> header and the data in JSON format.

## **Conclusion**

In this article, we explored the training and deployment of an unsupervised learning model using the K-means algorithm and the Iris dataset. We demonstrated how to train the model, export it, and create a Flask API to expose the model and make predictions.
