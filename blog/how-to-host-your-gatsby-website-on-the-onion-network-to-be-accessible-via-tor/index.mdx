The first thing you need to do is learn how to host any website in an Onion network. Let's start building a simple website.
Create an <code>index.html</code> inside a new directory.
```html
<h1>Hi</h1>
```
We will use [OnionShare](https://onionshare.org/) to host a website on the Onion network. I'm using a MAC M1 to create this project. To install the OnionShare, you must execute <code>brew install --cash onionshare</code>.
Open the program and go to Host a Website.
<MDXImageBody img={props.data} index={2} alt={"onionshare home page"}/>
<br/>

Add the directory you created the <code>index.html</code> file inside, check the option <code>This is a public OnionShare service (disabeles private key)</code>, and click on <code>Start sharing</code>. You will receive an address like this: http://6nvrcuddztfiokksb7phvnv6k4xfu64xpcm55joj5znije22rdsob7id.onion
<MDXImageBody img={props.data} index={3} alt={"onionshare website host page"}/>
<br/>

Open the address in a browser with Onion network access, and you will see your website.
<MDXImageBody img={props.data} index={1} alt={"a small website in onion network"}/>
<br/>

Now in your Gatsby project, if you are like me and don't change anything default in your project, you need to execute <code>npm run build</code>. In the end, you will have a directory with the name public.

Add your public directory in OnionShare and now check the option <code>Don't send default Content Security Policy header (allows your website to use third-party resources)</code> and Start again.

Open your link, and done! Everything is working! Well, most everything, you don't have HTTPS, and things like ServiceWorker won't work. But I want to have a little experience with an Onion network; it's a great result!
<MDXImageBody img={props.data} index={0} alt={"a blog home in onion network"}/>

I'm waiting for my Orange Pi 5 to arrive, and then I pretend to put my Bitcoin node on it and host my website in an Onion network. When I do that, I'll update this post with an Onion link to my website.
