I use a traditional Ubuntu desktop operational system. I explain why in this other post, where I detail my first experience with this.

After the first configuration and with an Umbrel running, I stop to see the Ubuntu to see what I have running.

I am not a security professional, and my knowledge in the area is minimal, so take this text as an initial guide for personal projects. If you want professional security, seek a professional. I work in the Back End and am good at creating security vulnerabilities, not fixing them.

In the end, I didn't do practically anything. I'm posting here to keep track of what I should have done. If you see anything wrong, please let me know.

First, I got my public IP and tried connecting over the SSH port.

```bash
>curl ifconfig.me
111.111.111.11
```

After that, try:

```bash
>ssh 111.111.111.11                                                                                                                                   ricardochaves@Ricardos-MacBook-Pro
ssh: connect to host 111.111.111.11 port 22: Connection refused
```

Here I was calmer because I still needed to change the ssh password.

Now I wanted tools to help me check for vulnerabilities in my Linux configuration. Searching on Google, I found some and started with [Lynis](https://cisofy.com/lynis/).

To install and run, it's just this:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CISOfy/lynis
cd lynis
./lynis audit system
```

At the end of the extensible report, they give me 47 suggestions:

```bash
* This release is more than 4 months old. Check the website or GitHub to see if there is an update available. [LYNIS]
      https://cisofy.com/lynis/controls/LYNIS/
```
I can't do anything here. I have the newest version

```bash
* Consider hardening system services [BOOT-5264]
    - Details  : Run '/usr/bin/systemd-analyze security SERVICE' for each service
      https://cisofy.com/lynis/controls/BOOT-5264/
```
When I did it with Docker, it was all red... There are many services, and I will need time to check them one by one... If I'm going to do it.

```bash
* Determine why /vmlinuz or /boot/vmlinuz is missing on this Debian/Ubuntu system. [KRNL-5788]
    - Details  : /vmlinuz or /boot/vmlinuz
      https://cisofy.com/lynis/controls/KRNL-5788/
```
I need help understanding that vulnerability; I have the file /boot/vmlinuz-****. I am trying to understand why the test question this.

```bash
* If not required, consider explicit disabling of core dump in /etc/security/limits.conf file [KRNL-5820]
      https://cisofy.com/lynis/controls/KRNL-5820/
```
Here I edited the <code>file/etc/sysctl.conf</code> and added <code>fs.suid_dumpable = 0</code> at the end of the file. After I did a reload of <code>sysctl</code> with the command sudo <code>sysctl -p</code>

```bash
* Check process listing for processes waiting for IO requests [PROC-3614]
      https://cisofy.com/lynis/controls/PROC-3614/
```
I'm using a lot of disks, and I'll see it when I reduce the use.

```bash
* Install a PAM module for password strength testing like pam_cracklib or pam_passwdqc [AUTH-9262]
      https://cisofy.com/lynis/controls/AUTH-9262/
```
Here we need to install the <code>cracklib</code> and edit the file <code>/etc/pam.d/common-password</code>:
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y libpam-cracklib
sudo nano /etc/pam.d/common-password
```
Find the first line and replace it with the second:

```text
password        requisite                       pam_cracklib.so retry=3 minlen=8 difok=3
password        requisite                       pam_cracklib.so retry=3 minlen=16 difok=3 ucredit=-1 lcredit=-2 dcredit=-2 ocredit=-2
```
Next:

```bash
* When possible set expire dates for all password protected accounts [AUTH-9282]
      https://cisofy.com/lynis/controls/AUTH-9282/
```
At the moment, I'm not going to set anything to expire. If I start with that soon, I'll be doing key rotation and everything, which is too advanced for me.

```bash
* Configure minimum password age in /etc/login.defs [AUTH-9286]
      https://cisofy.com/lynis/controls/AUTH-9286/
```
Again, it's about password times. I don't wanna change anything about this.

```bash
* Configure maximum password age in /etc/login.defs [AUTH-9286]
      https://cisofy.com/lynis/controls/AUTH-9286/
```
The same as the previous.

```bash
* Default umask in /etc/login.defs could be more strict like 027 [AUTH-9328]
      https://cisofy.com/lynis/controls/AUTH-9328/
```
This guy is more of a problem when you have multiple users. In my case, it's just me, and it's okay that the access permission I create stays at default.

```bash
* To decrease the impact of a full /home file system, place /home on a separate partition [FILE-6310]
      https://cisofy.com/lynis/controls/FILE-6310/
```
From what I understand, this guy would also be a problem if more people were using my Linux. Which is not my case either.

```bash
* To decrease the impact of a full /var file system, place /var on a separate partition [FILE-6310]
      https://cisofy.com/lynis/controls/FILE-6310/
```
Same case as above, only with another directory.

```bash
* Disable drivers like USB storage when not used, to prevent unauthorized storage or data theft [USB-1000]
      https://cisofy.com/lynis/controls/USB-1000/
```
This is a false positive. I need the USB connected directly. I explained in the previous post linked at the beginning of the article.

```bash
* Check DNS configuration for the dns domain name [NAME-4028]
      https://cisofy.com/lynis/controls/NAME-4028/
```
This one I didn't understand this… The Lynis documentation is terrible…

```bash
* Split resolving between localhost and the hostname of the system [NAME-4406]
      https://cisofy.com/lynis/controls/NAME-4406/
```
I wanna this behave. I do not change it.

```bash
* Install debsums utility for the verification of packages with known good database. [PKGS-7370]
      https://cisofy.com/lynis/controls/PKGS-7370/
```
I installed <code>debsums</code> and ran <code>debsums | grep FAILED</code>, and I had this result. Later I will analyze case by case. But that's for a future post.

```bash
/usr/bin/rkaiq_3A_server                                                  FAILED
debsums: missing file /usr/lib/NetworkManager/conf.d/10-globally-managed-devices.conf (from network-manager package)

/etc/skel/.config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/xfwm4.xml              FAILED
```

```bash
* Install package apt-show-versions for patch management purposes [PKGS-7394]
      https://cisofy.com/lynis/controls/PKGS-7394/
```
I even installed the package to learn with this one, but I don't even know if I'll remember to use it constantly: sudo apt-get install apt-show-versions. Please look at their doc to understand what it does and uses there, which is fantastic.

```bash
* Determine if protocol 'dccp' is really needed on this system [NETW-3200]
      https://cisofy.com/lynis/controls/NETW-3200/
```
Now it started to get really complicated… I started talking to ChatGPT to understand the protocol and how to check if it was being used. I came to the following conclusion, type the two commands below and check if it is in use:

```bash
netstat -an | grep dccp
ss -p | grep dccp
```
As there was no response, I am assuming that it is not in use, and I will execute the command to add it to the blocklist and then restart the Orange Pi:

```bash
sudo echo "blacklist dccp" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
```

```bash
* Determine if protocol 'sctp' is really needed on this system [NETW-3200]
      https://cisofy.com/lynis/controls/NETW-3200/
```
The same as the before

```bash
* Determine if protocol 'rds' is really needed on this system [NETW-3200]
      https://cisofy.com/lynis/controls/NETW-3200/
```
The same as the before

```bash
* Determine if protocol 'tipc' is really needed on this system [NETW-3200]
      https://cisofy.com/lynis/controls/NETW-3200/
```
The same as the before

```bash
* Access to CUPS configuration could be more strict. [PRNT-2307]
      https://cisofy.com/lynis/controls/PRNT-2307/
```
I don't have a printer, so I didn't even think about it and already restricted access:
```bash
sudo chown root:lpadmin /etc/cups/cupsd.conf
sudo chmod 640 /etc/cups/cupsd.conf
```

```bash
* Check iptables rules to see which rules are currently not used [FIRE-4513]
      https://cisofy.com/lynis/controls/FIRE-4513/
```
I don't have the ability to see... I'll need to study more to verify what's actually in use.

```bash
* Consider hardening SSH configuration [SSH-7408]
    - Details  : AllowTcpForwarding (set YES to NO)
      https://cisofy.com/lynis/controls/SSH-7408/

  * Consider hardening SSH configuration [SSH-7408]
    - Details  : ClientAliveCountMax (set 3 to 2)
      https://cisofy.com/lynis/controls/SSH-7408/

  * Consider hardening SSH configuration [SSH-7408]
    - Details  : LogLevel (set INFO to VERBOSE)
      https://cisofy.com/lynis/controls/SSH-7408/

  * Consider hardening SSH configuration [SSH-7408]
    - Details  : MaxAuthTries (set 6 to 3)
      https://cisofy.com/lynis/controls/SSH-7408/

  * Consider hardening SSH configuration [SSH-7408]
    - Details  : MaxSessions (set 10 to 2)
      https://cisofy.com/lynis/controls/SSH-7408/

  * Consider hardening SSH configuration [SSH-7408]
    - Details  : PermitRootLogin (set YES to (FORCED-COMMANDS-ONLY|NO|PROHIBIT-PASSWORD|WITHOUT-PASSWORD))
      https://cisofy.com/lynis/controls/SSH-7408/

  * Consider hardening SSH configuration [SSH-7408]
    - Details  : Port (set 22 to )
      https://cisofy.com/lynis/controls/SSH-7408/

  * Consider hardening SSH configuration [SSH-7408]
    - Details  : TCPKeepAlive (set YES to NO)
      https://cisofy.com/lynis/controls/SSH-7408/

  * Consider hardening SSH configuration [SSH-7408]
    - Details  : X11Forwarding (set YES to NO)
      https://cisofy.com/lynis/controls/SSH-7408/

  * Consider hardening SSH configuration [SSH-7408]
    - Details  : AllowAgentForwarding (set YES to NO)
      https://cisofy.com/lynis/controls/SSH-7408/
```
Here it says to be more strict on the SSH configuration. I'm not going to do that now, I use it a lot, and things like keeping the connection open are helpful.

```bash
* Enable logging to an external logging host for archiving purposes and additional protection [LOGG-2154]
      https://cisofy.com/lynis/controls/LOGG-2154/
```
I will not send my logs elsewhere. In my scenario, it is overkill.

```bash
* Check what deleted files are still in use and why. [LOGG-2190]
      https://cisofy.com/lynis/controls/LOGG-2190/
```
The oldest file in my <code>/tmp</code> folder was 3 days old, I don't know if I did something wrong, but I'm okay at this point.

```bash
* Add legal banner to /etc/issue.net, to warn unauthorized users [BANN-7130]
      https://cisofy.com/lynis/controls/BANN-7130/
```
This one was pretty cool. I edited the <code>/etc/issue.net</code> file and put this text:

```bash
Go away
This is your last warning
If you try again you will get cancer.
```

```bash
* Enable process accounting [ACCT-9622]
      https://cisofy.com/lynis/controls/ACCT-9622/
```
I don't understand what to do with this...

```bash
* Enable sysstat to collect accounting (disabled) [ACCT-9626]
      https://cisofy.com/lynis/controls/ACCT-9626/
```
I'll leave it to install the suggested tools and study them one by one in the future.

```bash
* Enable auditd to collect audit information [ACCT-9628]
      https://cisofy.com/lynis/controls/ACCT-9628/
```
I installed oauditd and used the aureport command, and an excellent report appeared. Keep the note to study this better

```bash
* Check output of aa-status [MACF-6208]
    - Details  : /sys/kernel/security/apparmor/profiles
    - Solution : Run aa-status
      https://cisofy.com/lynis/controls/MACF-6208/
```
I tried everything that I could, but I couldn't solve this. I'll try later

```bash
* Install a file integrity tool to monitor changes to critical and sensitive files [FINT-4350]
      https://cisofy.com/lynis/controls/FINT-4350/
```
This one asks to install another security system. I'll see that later too.

```bash
* Determine if automation tools are present for system management [TOOL-5002]
      https://cisofy.com/lynis/controls/TOOL-5002/
```
It's asking to install automation tools. I'm not interested in that.

```bash
* Consider restricting file permissions [FILE-7524]
    - Details  : See screen output or log file
    - Solution : Use chmod to change file permissions
      https://cisofy.com/lynis/controls/FILE-7524/
```
Totally unclear here… I don't understand what I need to do precisely.

```bash
* One or more sysctl values differ from the scan profile and could be tweaked [KRNL-6000]
    - Solution : Change sysctl value or disable test (skip-test=KRNL-6000:<sysctl-key>)
      https://cisofy.com/lynis/controls/KRNL-6000/
```
I didn't understand this one, either. In my case, I'll leave everything as it is.

```bash
* Harden compilers like restricting access to root user only [HRDN-7222]
      https://cisofy.com/lynis/controls/HRDN-7222/
```
This one is cool. It tells you to remove compilers or register access. I will not remove it, but I will look into restricting access. I will not do it on my Orange Pi right now to avoid messing something up. This is new to me.

```bash
* Harden the system by installing at least one malware scanner, to perform periodic file system scans [HRDN-7230]
    - Solution : Install a tool like rkhunter, chkrootkit, OSSEC
      https://cisofy.com/lynis/controls/HRDN-7230/
```
Lastly, it asks to install a malware scanner tool, which makes sense to me. I am going to do it.


I learned a lot reading about each item, and I'll leave this post as a note to execute what was missing.

Do the same to better understand how the system works.

I will run this constantly.
