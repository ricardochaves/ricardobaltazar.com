I recently decided to use my free time to develop my own blog.

I started with a small search from services like WordPress, but why will I pay for a platform if I can create one from scratch and update my Front End knowledge? I decided to make a full static blog and register my journey from beginner to end.

I spoke with the best developers I have the honor to work with about what technology I can use, and the [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) showed up with the best choice.

The next step is to create my environment to start my studies. I have the [All Products Pack of JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/all/), and I started registering my experience in [Grammarly](grammarly.com), helping me improve my English.

After installing WebStorm IDE, creating a GitHub repository, and starting a new project, I configure my remote interpreter with the Node docker image.

I made a [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/quick-start/) for beginners.

So far, so good. [Now I have my first commit](https://github.com/ricardochaves/valhalla/commit/90ccdda7d804347416379dabbb3c50522f98923e).

Next step, I'll configure the deployment of my master branch in Gatsby Cloud... and... let's go! [It works](https://valhallamaster01094.gatsbyjs.io/), and this is my [tutorial completed](https://github.com/ricardochaves/valhalla).

I found my preferred template adapted for gatsby, and I decided to fork the repository and start work from this.

This is not a tech post, but that experience allowed me to learn a lot, and I will write posts about some themes.

If you can create something for yourself, do it. You will learn about technology and how to project and administrate a small project.
